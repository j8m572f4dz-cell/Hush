  <h1>Safety Notice</h1>
  <p>
   "Terms & Conditions (Legal Disclaimer)
Limitation of Liability & Assumption of Risk By purchasing and using the hush sound-blocking hoodie, you acknowledge that the product is designed to significantly reduce ambient noise. You agree that:

Assumption of Risk: You voluntarily assume all risks associated with reduced situational awareness while wearing the hood in a raised position.

Liability Waiver: hush shall not be held liable for any personal injury, property damage, or accidents resulting from the user’s inability to hear emergency signals, traffic, or other environmental hazards.

Proper Use: The user is solely responsible for determining when it is safe to engage the sound-blocking features of the garment.

Indemnification: You agree to indemnify and hold hush harmless from any claims or legal actions arising from the use of this product in unsafe environments.

Safety Guide for Customers
To ensure your peace and comfort never compromise your safety, please follow these guidelines:

Stay Stationary: We recommend using the sound-blocking hood only while sitting or standing in a secure, controlled environment (e.g., at home, in a library, or on a stationary plane/train).

Avoid Traffic: NEVER wear the hood up while walking near roads, cycling, scootering, or operating any motor vehicle. Your ability to hear horns, sirens, and engines is vital for road safety.

Public Awareness: Do not use the sound-blocking feature in crowded or unfamiliar public spaces where you need to remain alert to the movement of others.

Adult Supervision: We recommend that minors use this product only under the direct supervision of an adult who can monitor the surrounding environment.

Emergency Situations: In the event of an emergency or fire alarm, immediately lower the hood to regain full situational awareness."
